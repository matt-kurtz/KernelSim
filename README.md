# KernelSim

This is a Kernel Simulator that I constructed for my CS240 (Operating Systems) class. It's one of my first "big" projects and I learned a substantial amount of new libraries as well as further appreciating the common operating systems that we use on a day-to-day basis.

To run in a Linux environment, use the command `make` that compiles the necessary files in the `makefile` provided in this repository.
After compiling, run the program using `./ksim`.
To exit the program, use the `exit` command.
